 <body>
   
   <h2> Organized by Martin Lukac (martin.lukac@nu.edu.kz), Wiliam N. Hung, Tomoyuki Araki </h2>
   
   <h3>Supported by IEEE CIS <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~whung/ETTC/">Task Force on Quantum Computing</a></h3>

   <h4> Scope and Topics</h4>
   <p>Quantum computing (QC) represents a broad topic encompassing a large number of approaches, technologies and techniques focusing on the usage, application, design and understanding of quantum computing systems. Evolutionary Computing (EC) have been on several occasions directly linked to quantum computing such as quantum evolutionary computation or evolutionary design for quantum computer design, etc. Because quantum computing evolves in the very large Complex Hilbert space, evolutionary methods are a prime tool for exploration and exploitation of quantum properties.</p>
   <p>The aim of this special session on quantum and evolutionary computing is to provide a platform for researchers of various Fields to discuss the latest advances in related fields, technologies and approaches linking and using quantum and evolutionary approaches. The scope of this special session covers among others but not limited to the following topics: </p>
<ul>
<li> Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms
<li> Classical Evolutionary Algorithms for Design of Quantum Computers
<li> Evolutionary Algorithms for Reversible and Quantum Circuits design
<li> Quantum Mechanics Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms
<li> Entanglement and Superposition in  Evolutionary algorithms
<li> Quantum Evolution
<li> Simulation of quantum systems using evolutionary computing
<li> Evolutionary optimization of quantum circuits
<li> Evolutionary design of quantum error correction
<li> Evolutionary design of hermitian operators
<li> Evolutionary design of quantum algorithms
<li> Quantum placement, Routing, and optimization on Gated Quantum Computers, One Way Quantum Computers
   </ul>

 <h4> Submission Details</h4>
   
   <p> Format should be conforming to the IEEE conference format with details about the submission being same to the specifications of the genera IEEE CEC conference
   <p> Paper submission should be using the same electronic way as for the general CEC 2019 <a href="http://cec2019.org/papers.html#submission"> here</a>
